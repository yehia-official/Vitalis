## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light, muted rose (#F2D7D9) to evoke calm and care, reflecting the app's supportive role. This choice veers away from overused cliches about 'health' (such as green or blue).
- Background color: Very light, desaturated rose (#F8F1F2), to ensure a soft and unobtrusive backdrop that supports readability and ease of use.
- Accent color: Pale violet (#D0BCD5), positioned analogously to the primary hue, but with altered brightness and saturation levels. This accent color aims to introduce contrast and visual interest.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines, paired with 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text, offering an elegant and readable combination.
- Use clear and simple icons that visually represent the different features (medications, symptoms, emergency contacts, heart rate etc.).
- Maintain a clean and structured layout. Ensure the interface is intuitive, with clear navigation and consistent placement of elements to help users easily manage their heart health information.
- Incorporate subtle and gentle transitions for interactions and updates to keep users engaged without causing distraction, contributing to an intuitive experience.
