# Vitalis - Your Personal Heart Health Companion ❤️

Vitalis is more than just an app — it’s a mission born from a personal story and a deep passion for helping people take control of their heart health.

## 💡 Why Vitalis?

Originally, my dream was to become a cardiologist to help my sister who suffered from heart disease. Life took me into the world of programming instead. Although my sister passed away, my mission to help people live healthier lives never faded. Vitalis is my way of merging these worlds and continuing that journey.
